- 👋 <b>Hello there, I’m dean</b>

- ⭐ I'm here to revive my childhood love for creating things with coding
- 🌱 Currently learning Ruby and Swift
- 🙌 Definitely open to collaboration although I'm still learning
- 👷 My background is in Electrical Engineering with experience in the defence manufacturing industry
- 📫 Discord: <hanmilo.>
- ⚡ Fun fact: While working in Hanahan, S. Carolina, my friend who's decades older than I am & an avid hunter shared some wisdom,
  "Let me tell you something: You know, deer are lazy. If there's a path in the forest, the deer will take it. They do not like to waddle through the bushes--it's noisy & harder, although they get concealed. I'd make a path whenever I hunt & wait for them."
  Then in a quiet corner of my mind wondered if the system is doing the same to me.
