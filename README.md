- ⚡ Fun fact: While working in Hanahan, S. Carolina, my friend who's decades older than I am & an avid hunter shared some wisdom,
  "Let me tell you something: You know, deer are lazy. If there's a path in the forest, the deer will take it. They do not like to waddle through the bushes--it's noisy & harder, although they get concealed. I'd make a path whenever I hunt & wait for them."
  Then in a quiet corner of my mind wondered if the system is doing the same to me.
